# H1b job list

App may crash sometimes because Next.js server routes currently does not support reading files, which is needed for loading the list, and I don't want to deploy a dedicated server or database.(I'm using a workaround but it sometimes fails, causing a crash)

It apparently doesn't crash locally. So Feel free do download to code and run it on your machine!
